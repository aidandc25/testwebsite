                        <p>Aidan da Costa is honored to be the founder of Melodies for Humanity. Music has been a significant part of his life for many years. As a drum major at Lone Star High School, Aidan has helped lead the band to historic achievements, including placing 7th in the UIL State Marching contest. He has been playing the flute for 7 years and is a proud member of the Lone Star Wind Symphony, which performed as the 2024 TMEA honor band. Additionally, he enjoys playing the tenor saxophone in the school's jazz band.</p>
                        <p>Beyond his involvement in various musical ensembles and as a soloist, Aidan is deeply passionate about using music to make a positive impact on others. Through Melodies for Humanity, he aims to connect talented high school musicians with opportunities to perform for those who would be blessed by music such as individuals in senior centers and hospitals. He believes in the transformative power of music and its ability to uplift and inspire, and strives to spread joy and comfort through these performances.</p>
